I want to build a PG rental website similar to BookMyPG, but it's for my own 3-storey house which I’m renting out. I currently have PGs in 2 locations, but the site should support adding more dynamically. I’m okay with coding, but want free hosting and the ability to code from an Android tablet using tools like Gitpod or Replit.
