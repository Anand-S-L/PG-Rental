Prompt: Build a PG Rental Website with Angular + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL

I want to build a PG rental website similar to BookMyPG, but for only two PG locations for now. The website should be dynamic so that I can add more PGs later via an admin panel.

Key Requirements:

1. Frontend: Angular

Built with Angular

Should have routes for:

Home

PG Listings (/pgs)

Individual PG details (/pgs/:id)

Booking form

Contact form


Fully responsive (mobile/tablet-friendly)

Integrated with Spring Boot backend

Use proxy.conf.json for API requests in development

Build using ng build --configuration=production


2. Backend: Spring Boot

REST API using Spring Boot on port 8000

Exposes endpoints for:

Get all PG listings

Get PG by ID

Post a booking request

Contact admin


Embed Angular dist/ in src/main/resources/static

Add fallback controller to route all unknown paths to index.html


3. Database: PostgreSQL

Store PG details:

Location

Rooms (with or without bathroom)

Pricing

Availability


Store bookings and user messages


4. Initial PG Data:

Location: Map link

Rooms:

4 bedrooms with attached bathrooms

1 for ₹9000, 3 for ₹7500


1 bedroom with common bathroom for ₹5500


Amenities:

2-wheeler parking

200m from hospital/school

Main city location, all necessities nearby

Only 3 months old (neat and clean)

For bachelors only (no car allowed)



5. Server Deployment:

Host backend on Render (free tier)

Host frontend on Vercel or Firebase Hosting

Serve Angular app using custom server.js (Node.js) or Spring Boot embedded static assets

Configure fallback to index.html to support Angular routing


6. server.js Fix (if needed):

Use express.static to serve Angular app

Add wildcard route to serve index.html for all unknown paths

Ensure compatibility with path-to-regexp if using advanced routes


7. Tablet-Friendly Development:

Use Gitpod or Replit for full-stack development in the browser

Prefer free hosting services and tools


8. Optional Features:

Realtime room availability updates (polling or WebSockets)

Payment gateway integration (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe)

Admin dashboard for updating listings
